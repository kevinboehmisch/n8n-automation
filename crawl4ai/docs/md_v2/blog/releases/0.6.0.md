# Crawl4AI 0.6.0

*Release date: 2025‑04‑22*

0.6.0 is the **biggest jump** since the 0.5 series, packing a smarter browser core, pool‑based crawlers, and a ton of DX candy. Expect faster runs, lower RAM burn, and richer diagnostics.

| **Server & API** | **Crawler Pool Manager** endpoint, MCP socket + SSE support |
